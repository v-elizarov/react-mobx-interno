> ### Simple application (SPA) for home interior enjoyers. The app includes  landing page, projects gallery and simple blog with articles. User can visit the blog page and be able to select as multiple categories to sort articles. Same thing works for the project page but here we can pick only one category. To get more info about any project or read an article should go to right page with details.
